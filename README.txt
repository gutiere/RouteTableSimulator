Sonia SaraiElijah G.Sun VuTeam 3 Assignment 2In this assignment we implemented a router by creating a random number generator to make IP addresses (the destination), ports, cost, time,  and whether or not a certain route is active or inactive. There is also an updatable aspect to our route system where new routes are added and old routes also get added if there is a new cost associated with it as there can be number of routes to the same destination. If a certain route is inactive 3 times constantly then it will be removed. A new route is added every couple of seconds as we coded a time delay to see the iterations of the routes.
